# Awesome Profile Cards

Hello! We are the Awesome Reacters and this project is the result of our third and fourth modules at Adalab. On it, we've adapted to React a project that we previously developed on Javascript.We have also created a server that has the same functionality as the server created by the Adalab teachers. It's the Awesome Profile Cards; an application that allows you to create digital customized visit cards and share them with your contacts.

## The structure

The project consists of two pages:

A welcome landing page, with a brief explanation of the application.
The main page, where you can create your customized visit card.

## How it works.

1-First, you can add a personal touch to your future card by choosing a color palette from the options pannel or of a color Wheel.
2-Then, fill your personal information in the given fields and add your best picture. On the right side of the page, top side on mobile version, you will see the preview of your card as you are generating it.
3-If you are not that convinced by what you see, clicking on the "reset" button will delete the process of creating the card so you can start over again!
4-Finally, simply create your card by clicking on the "crear tarjeta" button and, voli√†! There's your customized visit card to share with your contacts. To ease that process, you'll find another button below that enables you to directly share it on Twitter, Linkedin, Pinterest, Whatsapp or Telegram .
